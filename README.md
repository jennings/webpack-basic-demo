webpack-basic-demo
==================

A tiny example of how webpack bundles files together.

## Usage

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

This generates the `main.js` file in the `dist` directory.

`main.js` is checked in so it's easy to see the output without having to
clone this repository.
